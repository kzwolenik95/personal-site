      - title: Kubernetes on Digital Ocean
        description: |
          [This project](https://github.com/kzwolenik95/kubernetes-on-digitalocean) was developed to showcase the automated deployment of a Kubernetes cluster on DigitalOcean, employing Terraform for infrastructure provisioning and GitOps practices for configuration management.
          - Automated Kubernetes cluster on DigitalOcean using Terraform and Flux CD, integrating Vault, Kong ingress with TLS and Prometheus stack for monitoring
          - It demonstrates my expertise in deploying a secure, observable Kubernetes cluster using modern DevOps methodologies
          - it integrates various cloud-native technologies and follows best practices to create a high-quality infrastructure solution

      - title: Roadmap.sh DevOps Challenges
        description: |
          Roadmap.sh DevOps challenges provide practical projects from basic server setups to advanced deployments, which **I often extended** by experimenting with my own approaches or tools to further hone my skills

          - ðŸ”­ [My Roadmap.sh Repository](https://github.com/orgs/roadmap-sh-kzwolenik95/repositories)
          - Highlighted Challenges:

            - [**Automated-Backups**](https://github.com/roadmap-sh-kzwolenik95/automated-backups): Proud of my clever pipeline design using the `dorny/paths-filter` action to skip jobs, reducing execution time
            - [**Dockerized-Service-Deployment**](https://github.com/roadmap-sh-kzwolenik95/dockerized-service-deployment): Utilized a distroless image and implemented caching in the GitHub Actions pipeline to reduce execution time
            - Several other [**intermediate**](https://github.com/orgs/roadmap-sh-kzwolenik95/repositories?q=topic%3Aintermediate) challenges that I extended further honing my DevOps skills

      - title: Cloud Admin L2
        subtitle: Aditi â€“ Bogota, Colombia, later Remote from Spain
        date: 2023.03 â€“ Present
        description: |
          As a Cloud Admin L2, **I manage Kubernetes clusters on Amazon EKS** as part of a Cluster-as-a-Service team, providing infrastructure for application teams across the organization. I operate and troubleshoot Terraform pipelines in GitLab that automate cluster provisioning and upgrades, working closely with the DevOps team responsible for maintaining the underlying Terraform modules. **I handle Kubernetes manifests for internal cluster-specific tools** and coordinate with AWS support to resolve infrastructure-related issues. I use Datadog to monitor cluster health, creating alerts and dashboards to ensure visibility for both our team and application owners. **My contributions include optimizing monitoring coverage while reducing Datadog costs** and enhancing team efficiency by developing CLI scripts that streamline routine tasks. I collaborate with application teams and the DevOps group to address cluster-related needs, ensuring reliable and scalable Kubernetes environments.
      - title: System Administrator
        subtitle: Comarch SAS â€“ Bogota, Colombia
        date: 2019.06 â€” 2023.03
        description: |
          As a System Administrator, I advanced to a 2nd line support role, **taking ownership of monitoring systems** and client communication. I managed on-premise Linux systems, Oracle databases, and evolving Java applications while supporting the transition of the web layer to Docker-based microservices and an early-stage Kubernetes deployment on OpenShift within the company's private cloud. **I implemented an automated interface for an internal tool, reducing a complex and error-prone one-hour manual process to a few minutes.** This automation not only improved operational efficiency but also minimized human error during critical workflows. **I automated server configurations using Bash, Python, and Ansible and maintained Jenkins pipelines**, troubleshooting deployments and contributing to permanent solutions. My monitoring responsibilities expanded **to configuring Prometheus and creating advanced Grafana dashboards** while continuing to enhance Nagios scripts for better system observability. I collaborated with international clients in Dominican Republic, Colombia and Argentina, addressing technical concerns and improving ticket response times. Additionally, I provided one-off SQL reports to meet client-specific requests, such as data integrity checks. Despite my new responsibilities, I continued to handle select tasks from my previous role to ensure consistent service quality and operational efficiency.
      - title: 1st line support enginner
        date: 2017.07 â€” 2019.06
        subtitle: Comarch SA â€“ Cracow, Poland
        description: |
          In this role, I provided technical support for on-premise Linux systems, Oracle databases, and Java applications on Apache, Tomcat, and Oracle WebLogic. **I automated routine tasks using Bash and Python scripts scheduled with cron, reducing manual work and improving efficiency.** I extended Nagios monitoring by creating custom scripts for system checks not covered by default, enhancing system visibility. By resolving tickets promptly and collaborating with 2nd line engineers and developers, I maintained high SLAs and improved incident response processes. I also documented monitoring procedures and standard operating workflows, facilitating better knowledge sharing across the team.

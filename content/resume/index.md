      - title: Kubernetes on Digital Ocean
        description: |
          [This project](https://github.com/kzwolenik95/kubernetes-on-digitalocean) was developed to showcase the automated deployment of a Kubernetes cluster on DigitalOcean, employing Terraform for infrastructure provisioning and GitOps practices for configuration management.
          - Automated Kubernetes cluster on DigitalOcean using Terraform and Flux CD, integrating Vault, Kong ingress with TLS and Prometheus stack for monitoring
          - It demonstrates my expertise in deploying a secure, observable Kubernetes cluster using modern DevOps methodologies
          - it integrates various cloud-native technologies and follows best practices to create a high-quality infrastructure solution

      - title: Roadmap.sh DevOps Challenges
        description: |
          Roadmap.sh DevOps challenges provide practical projects from basic server setups to advanced deployments, which **I often extended** by experimenting with my own approaches or tools to further hone my skills

          - ðŸ”­ [My Roadmap.sh Repository](https://github.com/orgs/roadmap-sh-kzwolenik95/repositories)
          - Highlighted Challenges:

            - [**Automated-Backups**](https://github.com/roadmap-sh-kzwolenik95/automated-backups): Proud of my clever pipeline design using the `dorny/paths-filter` action to skip jobs, reducing execution time
            - [**Dockerized-Service-Deployment**](https://github.com/roadmap-sh-kzwolenik95/dockerized-service-deployment): Utilized a distroless image and implemented caching in the GitHub Actions pipeline to reduce execution time
            - Several other [**intermediate**](https://github.com/orgs/roadmap-sh-kzwolenik95/repositories?q=topic%3Aintermediate) challenges that I extended further honing my DevOps skills
